# ITSM
ABC Tech is a mid-size organization operation in IT-enabled business segment over a decade. On an average ABC Tech receives 22-25k IT incidents/tickets, which were handled to best practice ITIL framework with incident management, problem management, change management and configuration management processes. These ITIL practices attained matured process level and a recent audit confirmed that further improvement initiatives may not yield return of investment.        ABC Tech management is looking for ways to improve the incident management process as recent customer survey results shows that incident management is rated as poor.
